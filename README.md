This retirement calculator aims to give insight into which variables affect when you can retire, and how even small changes to e.g. inflation, or the percentage of tax-free wealth, can affect your retirement projection.

It is a long way from being fully accurate, as certain things such as inflation and yearly ROI can vary greatly over the years,
and none of that is built in to this calculation.

This project is provided as-is. I do not intend to spend a lot of time maintaining it, so please fork this repository if you intend to make changes.
